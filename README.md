# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

## Overview

Rossmann Pharmaceuticals, a leading pharmaceutical company, has approached you as a Machine Learning Engineer to build an end-to-end product that can forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. This project aims to develop a robust sales prediction model using machine learning techniques and serve the predictions through a web interface.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

1. **Exploration of customer purchasing behavior**: Conduct an extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the factors influencing customer purchasing behavior, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

2. **Prediction of store sales**: Develop and fine-tune both machine learning and deep learning models to accurately predict the store sales six weeks in advance.

3. **Serving predictions on a web interface**: Build a web-based application that can serve the sales predictions to the finance team.
